### Architecture Overview


 Network Layer
Custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16)

2 Public Subnets (one per Availability Zone)

2 Private Subnets for application servers

Internet Gateway for public traffic

NAT Gateways in each AZ for secure outbound access from private instances



⚖️ Load Balancing
Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic across instances in multiple AZs

Integrated health checks automatically detect and remove unhealthy servers



🖥 Compute Layer
Auto Scaling Groups deployed across private subnets

Automatically:

Launches new EC2 instances when load increases

Replaces unhealthy instances (auto-healing)



🗄 Data Layer
Amazon RDS deployed in private subnet

Used for persistent backend data storage

Secured from direct internet access



📦 Storage & Backup
Amazon S3 used for backup/static storage

Designed for durability and disaster recovery support



🌐 DNS
Amazon Route 53 routes traffic to the ALB endpoint

🔁 How Auto-Healing Works
ALB performs continuous health checks on EC2 instances

If an instance fails:

It is marked unhealthy

Auto Scaling Group terminates and replaces it automatically

Traffic is only routed to healthy instances



Result: No manual intervention required — the system heals itself.
